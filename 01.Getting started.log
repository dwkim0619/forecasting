1.1 What can be forecast?
  - The predictability of an event or a quantity depends on 
    several factors including:
    1. how well we understand the factors that contribute to it;
    2. how much data is available;
    3. whether the forecasts can affect the thing we are trying to forecast

  ex) the exchange rates become their own forecasts 
      forecasters need to be aware of their own limitations, and 
          not claim more than is possible.

in advance (~보다) 앞선, 사전에
beforehand 사전에; ...전에 미리
contribute (...의)한 원인이 되다, 기여하다

in a sense 어떤 의미에서는, 어느 정도(까지는)
consequently 그 결과, 따라서

  - Often in forecasting, 
    a key step is knowing
        when something can be forecast accurately,
        and
        when forecasts will be no better than tossing a coin.

  - Good forecasts capture
    the genuine patterns and relationships
        which exist in the historical data

  - will learn
    how to tell the difference
    between
      a random fluctuation in the past data that should be ignored,
    and 
      a genuine pattern that should be modelled and extrapolated.

  - Every environment is changing, and 
    a good forecasting model 
      captures
          the way in which things are changing.

  - What is normally assumed is 
    that the way in which the environment is changing
    will continue into the future.

    a highly volatile environment will continue to be highly volatile

  - A forecasting model
    is intended 
    to capture the way things move,
    not just where things are.

  "If we could first know 
      where we are 
      and
      whither we are tending,
  we could better judge 
      what to do
      and
      how to do it"

1.2 Forecasting, planning and goals
  - Forecasting
    - is about predicting the future as accurately as possible

    - Short-term forecasts
      the scheduling of personnel, production and transportation
      forecasts of demand
    - Medium-term forecasts
      determine future resource requirements in order to 
        purchase raw materail, 
                  hire personnel, 
        or buy machinery and equipment
    - Long-term forecasts
      strategic planning(market opportunities, environmental factors and internal resources)
  - Goals
    - are what you would like to have happen.
    - Goals should be linked to forecasts and plans
    - Too often,
      goals are set 
        without any plan 
          for how to achieve them
        and no forecasts
          for whether they are realistic.
  - Planning
    - is a response to forecasts and goals.
    - involves determining the appropriate actions
      that are required to make your forecasts match your goals.

1.3 Determining what to forecast

1.4 Forecasting data and methods
  - Qualitative forecasting
    - If there are no data available, or
    - if the data available are not relevant to the forecasts
  - Quantitative forecasting
    - numerical information about the past is available;
    - it is reasonable to assume 
      that some aspects of the past patterns will continue into the future
    - time series data(collected at regular intervals over time)
    - cross-sectional data(collected at a single point in time)
  - Time series forecasting
    - Anything that is observed sequentially over time is a time series.
    - the aim is to estimate 
      how the sequence of observations will continue into the future
    - decomposition models, exponential smoothing models and ARIMA models
  - Predictor variables and time series forecasting
    - An explanatory model is useful 
      because it incorporates information about other variables,
        rather than only historical values of the variable to be forecast
    - there are several reasons a forecaster might select a time series model 
      rather than an explanatory or mixed model : 
      1. the system may not be understood
         it may be extremely difficult to measure the relationships
          that are assumed to govern its behaviour.
      2. it is necessary to know or forecast the future values of the various predictors
         in order to be able to forecast the variable of interest, and this may be too difficult.
      3. the main concern may be only to predict
         what will happen,
         not to know why it happens.
      4. may give more accurate

1.5 Some case studies

1.6 The basic steps in a forecasting task
  - Step 1: Problem definition.
    - the most difficult part
  - Step 2: Gathering information.
    - at least two kinds of information required:
      a. statistical data, and
      b. the accumulated expertise of the people who collect the data and use the forecasts
    - the judgmental forecasting methods : will be difficult to obtain enough historical data
  - Step 3: Preliminary(exploratory) analysis.
    - Always start by graphing the data
    - consistent patterns, significant trend, seasonality ?
  - Step 4: Choosing and fitting models.
    - It is common to compare two or three potential models.
    - regression models
      exponential smoothing methods
      Box-Jenkins ARIMA models
      Dynamic regression models
      Hierarchical forecasting
      several advanced methods including neural networks and vector autoregression
  - Step 5: Using and evaluating a forecasting model.
    - how to handle missing values and outliers, or 
    - how to deal with short time series.

  1.7 The statistical forecasting perspective
    - the further ahead we forecast, the more uncertain we are.
    - prediction interval
    - point forecasts
    - forecast distribution(probability distribution)
    - "forecast" : the average value of the forecast distribution
      => a “hat” over y
